## Computer Database CQRS Sample Project

This project demonstrates how to use a CQRS architecture (with [Axon Framework](http://www.axonframework.org/)) in a [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) web application.

It is based on the [Computer Database JPA sample](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/tree/master/samples/java/computer-database-jpa).

Before you could run the web application, you have to install the CQRS package into your local repository first (mvn install).

To create sample datasets, call http://localhost:9000/setup/data
